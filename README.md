# ExtensionAwareness
Simple example using a library to manage awareness over what functional extensions are installed.

In this example, the assumption is there are the following extension structure:
- Extension 1
- Extension 2
- Library (shared by Extension 1 and Extension 2)

I've split out the files into folders that represent which extension they would be created in. I've also included a sample test usage that can be added to either Extension 1 or Extension 2.
